I have eaten Fruity Yogurt all my life so I can't get enough of it, but when they came out with a variety of fruity yogurt flavors, I was even happier. It is something that you can eat anytime of the day and enjoy it.

Hello, I just wanted to say that this yogurt is amazing. I would recommend it to anyone. It's a great snack and it's good for you. It's healthy too. I like the flavors very well. They're tasty. It's not too sweet

Very nice flavors and a good price. I can buy it for my kids, who love Fruity Yogurt and they are very happy with it.
